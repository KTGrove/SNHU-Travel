# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs via user stories is the most help-ful method in ensuring that client/user requests are being met. When having a client create a user story,
it gives the developer specific goals to meet so when it comes time for the tester to test the viability of the program they can relay whether or not the client requests have been fullfilled.
The tester can also use the user stories when creating their test cases to relay information to the developers on any necessary changes that may need to be made. 
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development with an agile method in mind. I like the organization, the breakdown by task and priority, and when in a group, the delegation of those tasks. 
I hope to better integrate the task and goal management into my development work. I am already a avery list and goal oriented person, breaking things down even further
and listing things by priority would help me stay organized in all future processes. 
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is present for all scrum meetings, they complete their tasks and communicate issues when necessary. They also offer aid to those who need it
and communicate any other ideas they may have that would help the team progress toward their goals. A good team member makes the project easier, not harder than it needs to be, 
and they take pride in the work they're doing alongside thier team members.
